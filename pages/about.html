        <p>My name is</p>
        <h2>Robert 'Rob-One' Wägar</h2>
        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">This is me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Dad to two beautiful boys, I'm a developer & I'm a dancer(dance teacher)</br>
                Yes I got two professions and both are also my hobbies.
                I have the opportunity to be creative, and learn new things while working, this is awesome and gives me
                a boost everyday. <br>
                I love both of my jobs! I found good helpful friends in both industries & I'm greatful for this.
                I see myself as a tech and dance "nerd" <br>
                I speak Swedish, Finnish & English, I love great movies mostly classics & cartoons, taking long walks in
                the forest to clear my mind and breathe
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">My developer work</h2>
            <p>
                Is to build smart
                user interfaces & useful interactions and develop functionality of web pages with Javascript, React,
                Next.js with sass, styled-components, tailwind, framer-motion, anime.js, MERN stack, currently
                learning Typescript amongst other new tech and trying out new as
                often as possible. <br>
                I have also done smaller projects a few years ago in JAVA and C#, only basic usage.
                Here is an example of a project I did for a customer in LA / US
                <a href="./projects.html#p1">Check project</a>

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Inspiration Ideas Creativity</h2>
            <p> I'm always looking for creative solutions in everythings life.
                Without creativity we would be standing still, to inspire others to find and learn new things, is one
                of
                the hightlight of my life. I love seeing others reach their goals and make their dreams come true.
                I'm happy that I have been able to help others, inspiring new
                generations in dancing, and in the future looking forward
                to help new developers</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Creativity art design and technology</h2>
            <p>I belive that these skills with the right mindset & in the right hands, is the 'tools' to solve our
                future problems.
                We should always thrive to find new and better ways, and keep in mind that we are creative beings, if
                allowed to enhance and boost those abilities

        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">My work as a dancer</h2>
            <p>
                I been working with artforms within the dance "world", since 1990, performing, teaching, organizing, helping
                schools to
                find "streetdance" teachers, mentoring dancers,
                set schedules, worked with different projects, also with non-profit organizations and inspired the youth
                and kids to move their bodies. 
                I've aslo been deeply involved and interested in the artforms and
                culture of HIP-HOP & FUNK, a deep passion for the dance style & artform of locking<br>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Dance and code? Connection?</h2>
            <p>
                Working with creativity and artforms has helped me a lot in my life, and now when
                I'm coding I see the similarities between the two. Co-work, team-work is a key to better "performance" and also communication is must to be able to work together. 
                If there is a problem, analyze it and find a solution. 
                <br>
                In the artform of Hip-Hop, there is a saying - ALWAYS A STUDENT, in otherwords always be open to learn new,
                so this is what I saw in
                programming, and it might not be the same
                vocabulary, but the same thought. <br>
                 <br>
                Today both dancing and developing, learning new as I go and working with this for a few years, coding just becomes more fun
                for everyday that passes. :D
