        <p>My name is</p>
        <h2>Robert 'Rob-One' Wägar</h2>
        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">This is me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Dad to two beautiful boys, I'm a developer & I'm a dancer(dance teacher)</br>
                Yes I got two professions and both are also my hobbies.
                I have the opportunity to be creative, and learn new things while working, this is awesome and gives me
                a boost everyday. <br>
                I love both of my jobs! I found good helpful friends in both industries & I'm greatful for this.
                I see myself as a tech and dance "nerd" <br>
                I speak Swedish, Finnish & English, I love great movies mostly classics & cartoons, taking long walks in
                the forest to clear my mind and breathe.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">My developer work</h2>
            <p>
                Is to build smart
                user interfaces & useful interactions and develop functionality of web pages with Javascript (currently
                learning Typescript), React,
                Next.js with sass, styled-components, tailwind, framer-motion, anime.js etc and trying out new stack as
                often as possible. <br>
                I have also done smaller projects a few years ago in JAVA and C#, but they are not my main languages.
                Here you can see an example of a solo project I did on the side of other work for a customer in LA.

            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Inspiration Ideas Creativity</h2>
            <p> I'm always looking for creative solutions in everythings life.
                Without creativity we would be standing still, and to inspire other to find and learn new things, is one
                of
                the hightlight of my life. I love seeing others reach their goals and make their dreams come true.
                That's
                why I'm happy that I in my carreer as a dance teacher have succeeded in doing so, inspiring new
                generations & in coding helping people get their ideas to life, now also in the future looking forward
                to help new developers</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Creativity art design and technology</h2>
            <p>I belive that these skills with the right mindset & in the right hands, is the 'tools' to solve our
                future problems.
                We should always thrive to find new and better ways, and keep in mind that we are creative beings if
                allowed to develop and boost those abilities.

        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">My work as a dancer</h2>
            <p>
                I been working with artforms within dance "world", since 1990, performing, teaching, organizing, helping
                schools to
                find the right teachers, mentoring dancers,
                set schedules, worked with differnt projects, also with non profit assosiations and inpired the youth
                and kids to move their bodies,
                to what i consider is good music. I've aslo been deeply involved and interested in the artforms and
                culture of HIP-HOP & FUNK with the dance style locking close to my heart<br>
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2 class="textSplit fadeInRight stop">Dance and code? Connection?</h2>
            <p>
                So working with creativity and artforms has helped me a lot in my life to find solutions, and now when
                I'm coding I see the similarities
                between the two. If there is a problem, find a solution.
                <br>
                In the artform of Hip-Hop I many times say - ALWAYS A STUDENT in otherwords always be open to learn new,
                so this is what I saw in
                programming, and it might not be the same
                vocabulary, but the same thought somehow. <br>
                I was interested... <br>
                now been developing, learning new as I go and working with this for a few years, just becomes more fun
                for everyday that passes. :D
