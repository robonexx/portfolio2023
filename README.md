# PORTFOLIO
## Assignment - 5


So our 5th assignment is to create a portfolio
so i've gathered everything i learned and 
tried out so far

I will use file structure from assignment 1
first page from assitnemnt 3 as my hero section
and some more

I will use some libraries might use Jquery for nav just to add a little what ive done testing with jQuery

- open close button js
- nav desktop - mobile (will be multilevel)
- animations effect js / 2 different
- color generator for one page
- will work on this then add more

## navigations dropdown

This was one of the things to ac

### Issues, thoughts, fixes

- css in general is kind of easy and
at the same time not easy at all, ;)

- I understand why people use bootstrap and tailwind, but my goal is to build my own library, in this process learn more and come up with new ideas.

- So body should probably never have a width of 100vw, it messes up proportions

- Breaking down functions to smaller ones is a challenge, but working on it

- Text effect using javascript was a challendge its not perfect but its working

- Color "random generator function was fun (maybe try to add opacity to it)

- keyframes and transitions is too much fun
could spend our on this, love it. It makes the
pages come alive. Definitly need to get better and deep dive at one point

- i work in separate project testing before adding, i like this, i could just do  more branches, but I kind of like having it locally for now. Probably will add branches so i can keep some ideas and test online
